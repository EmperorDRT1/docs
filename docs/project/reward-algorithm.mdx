Rewarding the members of our network for sharing their local weather data is a crucial part of our system (**currently on testnet**).

Our **Reward Algorithm** is a unique, fair, and transparent algorithm that will handle how rewards are being distributed to the network members.

We are currently on the first iteration of that algorithm, which has been implemented in a basic wayâ€”only taking into account whether or not a station is connected to the network.

The algorithm is comprised of three steps:
  - The minting of the WXM Testnet tokens
  - The validation of the weather stations and their weather data
  - The reward distribution


:::note Important
Connecting a wallet is mandatory for receiving rewards. If a user does not have a wallet connected, the rewards will be lost.

## How Often does the Reward Algorithm run?
The algorithm runs every day and takes account for the previous day. 

## Validation
`validation_score = array_of_hourly_weather_data / 24`

### Explanation
In the validation step, the algorithm takes into account the weather data for each hour of the previous day for any given weather station.
  - If the weather station has successfully sent data for each hour of the previous day, then the algorithm's input is an array of 24 objects,
   with each object being the station's weather data.
  - If the weather station hasn't sent any weather data for 1 or more hours the previous day, then the algorithm's input is an array of (24-X) objects, 
  with each object being the station's weather data and X being the number of hours that the station hasn't communicated with our system.

That input is then being used by dividing its length by 24 (the maximum hours per day) to get a `validation_score` of `0.0` to `1.0`.

## Reward distribution
`weather_station_reward = validation_score * max_daily_reward`

### Explanation
After the validation step, the algorithm takes the `validation_score` for any given weather station in our network, multiplies it with the `max_daily_reward` that the weather 
station can get, and the result is the amount of WXM tokens that the algorithm distributes to the user who owns that weather station.

:::note
As stated before, this is a basic first iteration. Our current plans are that, in the future, our algorithm will take into weighted consideration the following:
  - Location Coverage (density of weather stations in an area)
  - Weather Data Quality

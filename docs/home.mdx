## Getting Started

WeatherXM is a community-powered weather network, that rewards weather station owners and provides accurate weather services to Web3 enterprises.
WeatherXM stations are the worldâ€™s first natively supporting web3 technologies, all-in-one easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, designed for large-scale deployment.
WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.
